    Hi, I'm {shk}Rodney{shk} and I've lost my {clr3}kidney{clr3}. 
    {pg}
    You know, I used to be a singer. Now I'm just an old man...
    {pg}
    ... walking around like a ghost the streets of Glasgow ...
    {pg}
    Please, tell me! Tell me what did I do wrong?
    {pg}
    Did I sing too high? Have I sunk too low? 
    {pg}
    Just don't tell me you don't know...
